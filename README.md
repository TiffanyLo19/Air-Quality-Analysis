# Air Quality Analysis
This Python script utilizes various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, AdaBoost, and XGBoost, to analyze and predict air quality based on a dataset containing multiple environmental variables. It covers both regression and classification tasks, providing insights into temperature prediction and air quality classification.

## Results
The study found that Year, AH, RH%, NOx, and NO2 are closely linked to temperature. Year, NO2, Temp, Month, and RH% are strongly associated with AH. Charts and correlation matrices support these findings. Notably, "NOx_s" has little correlation with temperature and humidity but high negative correlations with reference and target chemicals. Increased NO2 levels were linked to higher temperatures. The accuracy for each target variable was over 85%, surpassing expectations. Future work involves exploring alternative machine learning models for improved accuracy.
